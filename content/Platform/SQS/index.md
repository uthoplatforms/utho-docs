# SQS (Simple Queue Service)
--- 
Simple Queue Service allows you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications by providing a reliable and highly scalable messaging system.SQS supports both standard and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues, allowing you to choose the message ordering and delivery behavior that fits your use case.
Overall, **UTHO** SQS is a reliable and scalable messaging service that helps you build loosely coupled, distributed systems in the cloud. It's commonly used for asynchronous communication between microservices, decoupling components of a system, and managing workloads in serverless architectures.

### SQS offer several benefits:

-   Cost-effectiveness
-   Fully Managed
-   Reliable
-   Scalability
-   Simple
-   Flexible
