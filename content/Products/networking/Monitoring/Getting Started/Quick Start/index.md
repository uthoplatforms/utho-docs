## **How to Use Monitoring in Utho Cloud**

### **Overview**

Monitoring in Utho Cloud helps users track and manage their cloud infrastructure’s performance. This includes monitoring resource utilization (such as CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network) and maintaining communication with key personnel through monitoring contacts. Utho Cloud enables users to set up resource alerts to notify them when thresholds are reached and allows managing contacts for efficient monitoring.
