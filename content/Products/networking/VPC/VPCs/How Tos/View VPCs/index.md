### **3. VPC Listing Page Overview**

On the VPC listing page, you’ll see a list of all the VPCs that have been deployed within your account, including the following details for each VPC:

1. **Location**

   * The **Location** field shows the data center (DC) location where your VPC has been deployed.
   * This information helps you know where your network resources are physically hosted, ensuring that your resources are located in the desired region or data center.
2. **Name**

   * The **Name** is the identifier given to the VPC at the time of deployment.
   * It helps you recognize and differentiate between multiple VPCs, especially when managing several environments (e.g., production, staging).
3. **Network**

   * The **Network** refers to the CIDR block assigned to the VPC at the time of creation. It is represented in a format like `10.137.0.0/20`, which defines the IP address range for the VPC.
   * This field helps you understand the range of IP addresses available for resources within the VPC.
4. **Action**

   * The **Action** button next to each VPC allows you to manage your VPC resources. By clicking this button, you can access options to modify, view detailed configurations, or delete the VPC if necessary.
