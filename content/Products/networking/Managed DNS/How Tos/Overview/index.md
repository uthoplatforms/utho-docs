### Resources Section

The **Resources Section** in Managed DNS is where users manage the DNS records associated with their domain. It allows for adding, modifying, or deleting records such as A records, MX records, CNAME records, and more. This section also helps organize and configure how domain traffic is routed to specific services, like web servers or email servers. It is essential for directing traffic correctly, ensuring services are accessible, and maintaining DNS health and performance. Advanced configurations like load balancing and traffic routing can also be managed here.

### Destroy Section

The **Destroy Section** in Managed DNS is used to remove unwanted or obsolete DNS records and configurations. Users can delete individual DNS records, DNS zones, or any associated resources like backend servers or routing rules. It is helpful for cleaning up DNS setups when domains, services, or resources are no longer required. This section ensures that unused configurations do not consume resources or cause security risks, providing a streamlined and secure DNS management process.

### NS Records 

**NS Records** (Name Server Records) define which DNS servers are authoritative for a domain. These records specify the servers responsible for managing and providing the DNS information for that domain. NS records are crucial for domain delegation, allowing the domain owner to delegate the responsibility of subdomains to different name servers. They are part of the DNS lookup process and help ensure that queries are directed to the correct server. Multiple NS records can be used for redundancy and ensuring high availability.
