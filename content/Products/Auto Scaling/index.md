# Auto Scaling
--- 

Auto scaling in cloud computing refers to the ability of a system to automatically adjust its computing resources based on workload changes. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the demand on the system fluctuates, such as web applications experiencing varying levels of traffic throughout the day.

## Auto Scaling offer several benefits:
- Monitoring
- Scaling Policies
- Scaling Actions
- Integration with Cloud Provider Services
- Cost Optimization
