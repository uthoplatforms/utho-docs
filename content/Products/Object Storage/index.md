# Object Storage
--- 
Object storage in the cloud refers to a method of storing and managing data in a distributed, scalable, and highly available manner. Instead of organizing data in a hierarchical file system structure like traditional storage systems, object storage systems store data as objects within a flat namespace.
These services are widely used for storing various types of data, including images, videos, documents, backups, and log files, among others.

### Object Storage offer several benefits:

-   Cost-effectiveness
-   Access via APIs
-   Durability
-   Scalability
