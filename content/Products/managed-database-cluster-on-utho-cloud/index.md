## Introduction:

Utho managed databases are a high-performance database cluster service that is completely managed. An effective substitute for manually installing, setting, maintaining, and safeguarding databases is to use managed databases. Every database cluster has automated failover, which means that malfunctioning or deteriorating nodes are automatically identified and replaced.

Step 1: **Login to Your Utho Profile:** Access the Utho Cloud platform and log in to your profile.
